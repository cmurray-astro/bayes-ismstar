Morning all,

As mentioned before, you'll want a few basic Python tools installed to follow along - specifically, Jupyter, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and emcee.  If you don't have those up and running yet I can help troubleshoot in some of the "work" time.

Once you've got that all running, you should be able to grab the materials from here:

you can either download it from the github interface or (better yet) clone the git repo if you are proficient in git.

See you all soon!
